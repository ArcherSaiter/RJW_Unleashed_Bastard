The faction of ugly bastards is here, for your ugly needs ||if you have them||
This group is very aggressive and is generally stronger that vanilla factions, and also has late-game designed raiders, so after 1k raid points, you might start getting small, but still strong raids. Less TPS damage, Yeah!

Featuring:
* 1 Hostile spacer faction
* Xenotypes: Ugly bastard and Bastard Coomer - beware, the latter is dangerous
* Integration with the latest version of RJW_Unleashed_Traits
Dependencies:
* RJW-Genes
* No Random Relations (until all relation bugs of RJW-Genes are fixed)
